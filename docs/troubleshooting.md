# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you diagnose and solve common issues you might encounter while using ESIHub Client.

## Common Issues

### 1. Authentication Errors

**Symptom**: You receive an `AuthenticationError` when making requests.

**Possible Causes and Solutions**:
- Expired access token: Refresh your token using the `refresh_token` method.
- Invalid client credentials: Double-check your client ID and secret.
- Incorrect scopes: Ensure you've requested the necessary scopes for your operations.

### 2. Rate Limiting Errors

**Symptom**: You receive a `RateLimitExceeded` error.

**Solution**: 
- The client should handle this automatically. If you're still seeing this error, try reducing your request frequency or increasing the rate limit in your ESIHubClient configuration.

### 3. Caching Issues

**Symptom**: Data seems outdated or caching doesn't appear to be working.

**Solutions**:
- Verify your Redis server is running and accessible.
- Check the cache expiration settings in your configuration.
- Ensure you're not bypassing the cache unintentionally.

### 4. Connection Pool Exhaustion

**Symptom**: You receive a `ConnectionPoolExhausted` error.

**Solution**: 
- Increase the size of your connection pool.
- Ensure you're properly closing your connections after use.

## Debugging Tips

1. Enable debug logging:
   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
   ```

2. Use OpenTelemetry tracing to get detailed insights into request flow.

3. Monitor Prometheus metrics to identify performance bottlenecks.
